ID	Definition | Type | Range

CIEND:	Confidence interval around END for imprecise variants | Integer | <Range N/A>
CIPOS:	Confidence interval around POS for imprecise variants | Integer | <Range N/A>
CS:	Source call set. | String | <Range N/A>
END:	End coordinate of this variant | Integer | <Range N/A>
IMPRECISE:	Imprecise structural variation | Flag | <Range N/A>
MC:	Merged calls. | String | <Range N/A>
MEINFO:	Mobile element info of the form NAME,START,END<POLARITY; If there is only 5' OR 3' support for this call, will be NULL NULL for START and END | String | <Range N/A>
MEND:	Mitochondrial end coordinate of inserted sequence | Integer | <Range N/A>
MLEN:	Estimated length of mitochondrial insert | Integer | <Range N/A>
MSTART:	Mitochondrial start coordinate of inserted sequence | Integer | <Range N/A>
SVLEN:	SV length. It is only calculated for structural variation MEIs. For other types of SVs; one may calculate the SV length by INFO:END-START+1, or by finding the difference between lengthes of REF and ALT alleles | Integer | <Range N/A>

AF:	Estimated allele frequency in the range (0,1) | Float | 0,1
NS:	Number of samples with data | Integer | <Range N/A>
AN:	Total number of alleles in called genotypes | Integer | <Range N/A>
EAS_AF:	Allele frequency in the EAS populations calculated from AC and AN, in the range (0,1) | Float | 0,1
EUR_AF:	Allele frequency in the EUR populations calculated from AC and AN, in the range (0,1) | Float | 0,1
AFR_AF:	Allele frequency in the AFR populations calculated from AC and AN, in the range (0,1) | Float | 0,1
AMR_AF:	Allele frequency in the AMR populations calculated from AC and AN, in the range (0,1) | Float | 0,1
SAS_AF:	Allele frequency in the SAS populations calculated from AC and AN, in the range (0,1) | Float | 0,1
DP:	Total read depth; only low coverage data were counted towards the DP, exome data were not used | Integer | <Range N/A>
AA:	Ancestral Allele. Format: AA|REF|ALT|IndelType. AA: Ancestral allele, REF:Reference Allele, ALT:Alternate Allele, IndelType:Type of Indel (REF, ALT and IndelType are only defined for indels) | String | <Range N/A>
