7 (of 7) markers to be included from [ /Users/joshuaburkhart/SoftwareProjects/ComputationalGenetics/hw2/example.map ]
5 individuals read from [ /Users/joshuaburkhart/SoftwareProjects/ComputationalGenetics/hw2/example.ped ] 
5 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
2 cases, 3 controls and 0 missing
2 males, 3 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 7 SNPs
5 founders and 0 non-founders found
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is 1
0 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 1 )
0 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0 )
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 7 SNPs
After filtering, 2 cases, 3 controls and 0 missing
After filtering, 2 males, 3 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
